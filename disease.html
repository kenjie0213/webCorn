            <h2>Corn Smut</h2>
            <p>This disease is caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis.  Disease development is favored by high 
                nitrogen level or high quantities of manure.  Injuries due to blowing soil or sand particles, 
                cultivation or detasseling may greatly increase the potential for smut infection. <br><br>
  
                <b>Symptoms</b> <br>
                Galls on aboveground parts, which are glistening white or grayish white tissues   <br>
                These galls later turn black due to masses of powdery black spores  <br><br>
                
                <b>Management</b><br>
                Follow a well balanced fertility program based on soil analysis <br>  
                Avoid injuring corn plants during cultivation   <br>
                Plant resistant varieties

            <h2>Downy Mildew</h2>
            <p>This disease is caused by a fungus, Peronosclerospora philippinensis, which affects corn plants 
                from two-leaf to silking stages. <br><br>
  
                <b>Symptoms</b> <br> 
                White or yellow streaks, first at the base then on the entire leaf blade <br>   
                Chlorosis (loss of greenness due to lack of chlorophyll)    <br>
                Dwarfing   <br>
                Ears and tassels poorly formed in severe infections 
                <br><br> 

                <b>Management</b><br>
                Sanitation involving the pulling out and burning infected plants as soon as they are observed 
                in the cornfield   <br>
                Synchronous planting   <br>
                Crop rotation   <br>
                Planting of resistant varieties  <br>

            <h2>Bacterial Stalk Rot</h2>
            <p>This disease is caused by the bacterium Erwinia carotovora, which affects corn plants from 
                two-leaf to maturity stages. <br><br>
  
               <b>Symptoms</b><br> 
                Stalk rot starting from the base progressing upward and eventually causing wilting of lowermost 
                leaves <br>   
                Infected inner tissues of older plants deteriorate and become soft with foul odor and later 
                dry up into easily disjointed fibers   <br>
                Plants infected before tasseling usually topple over while those infected at post 
                tasseling may remain standing but exhibit wilted leaves  <br><br>

                <b>Management</b>  <br> 
                Provide good drainage and improve soil condition through proper cultivation   <br>
                Practice balanced fertilization.  Generally, bacterial stalk rot is severe when there is 
                excessive nitrogen in the soil in relation to potassium.   <br>
                Avoid close planting on fields previously infected with the disease. <br>

            <h2>Banded Leaf and Sheath Blight  </h2>
            <p>  
                This disease is caused by the soil-borne fungus Rhizoctonia solani, which affects corn plants 
                from late whorl to ear formation. <br><br>
                  
                <b>Symptoms</b><br>
                Irregular blotches on the leaves, stalks and ears  <br> 
                Blotches are grayish-green, with bluish gray or straw colored centers and with distinct brown 
                borders   <br>
                Presence of irregular light to dark brown fungus lumps known as sclerotia on the dead tissues  <br> 
                Infected ears may be wholly or partially rotten showing some seed germination  <br><br>

                <b>Management</b><br>
                Practice sanitation by removing and burning infected leaves and stalks <br>  
                Bury the sclerotia by deep plowing   <br>
                Avoid planting varieties with very low ear placement  <br>

            <h2>Corn Mosaic</h2>
            <p>  
                This disease is caused by different strains of the maize dwarf mosaic virus.  
                It is transmitted by corn aphids and infects corn plants from whorl to maturity stages. <br><br>
  
                <b>Symptoms</b><br><br> 
                Narrow, pale yellow streaks on leaves parallel to leaf vein <br>  
                The pale area later becomes diffused upon a paler green background   <br>
                The base of infected leaves produces alternating broad streaks of green and pale green areas  <br><br>

                <b>Management</b><br>
                Plant resistant varieties <br>  
                Remove infected plants as symptoms appear   <br>
                Eliminate alternate hosts like weeds   <br>
                Plant early to avoid high aphid population

        <h2>Ear Rot</h2>
        <p>  
            This disease is caused by the fungus Diplodia maydis or Diplodia macrospora. <br><br>
  
            <b>Symptoms</b><br>
            Presence of bleached to straw-colored lesions starting from the base of the ear   <br>
            Husks tightly pasted together by the white fungus mycelium   <br>
            Black pycnidia scattered on the surface of the husks, kernels and cobs  <br><br>

            <b>Management</b><br>
            Avoid using highly susceptible varieties <br>
            Practice deep plowing and field sanitation.

        <h2>Leaf Rust</h2>
        <p>  
            This disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia polysora, which affects corn plants from mid-whorl 
            to silking stages. <br><br>
            
            <b>Symptom</b><br>
            Presence of small and circular brown rusty pustules or blisters on the upper and lower 
            surfaces of a leaf.  These pustules are rough to touch and later erupt and release numerous 
            rusty spores. <br><br>
            
            <b>Management</b><br>
            Plant resistant varieties to help reduce occurrence of the disease.
