                        This machine learning system is Corn Disease Detector System. It is system that can 
                        determine the type of disease that infect corn crops. Our System is designed to help 
                        farmers in monitoring the health of their corn crops by providing accurate information 
                        about common disease affecting corn crops. 
                        <br><br>
                        The system and website was created and developed by thrid year students of Ilocos Sur
                        Polythecnic State College - main campus in fufilling thier final project in CS313.

                <p> <b>Image Classifier </b><br><br>
                     An image classifier is a feature on a website that uses machine learning algorithms to 
                    analyze and categorize images based on their content. It can automatically identify and 
                    assign corn disease. Users can upload an image to the website, and the image classifier 
                    will process it and provid predictions about the posibble disease of the image.</p>

                <p> <b>Video Classifier </b><br><br>
                    Similar to the image classifier, a video classifier is a feature that also applies machine 
                    learning techniques to analyze and categorize videos based on the plant characteristics. 
                    Users can take a live video by allowing the website to access the phone camera and the 
                    video classifier will process it, often by analyzing the video, it will provide insights 
                    or predictions about the posibble disease of the plant.

                <p> <b>Corn Disease Directory </b><br><br>
                     A corn disease directory is a feature on a website that serves as 
                    a comprehensive reference or database of various diseases that affect corn plants. 
                    It provides information about different types of diseases, their symptoms, causes, and 
                    possible treatments. The directory may include images or descriptions of the diseases, as 
                    well as information about preventive measures or management strategies. Users, such as 
                    farmers or agricultural researchers, can access the directory to identify and learn about 
                    specific corn diseases they encounter in their fields, aiding in early detection and 
                    appropriate action to mitigate the impact on crop yields.
